# Face_Detection
This project is a real-time face detection application using OpenCV and the Haar Cascade Classifier. It captures video frames from the webcam, converts them to grayscale, and detects faces using a pre-trained XML model. Detected faces are highlighted with green rectangles in the live video feed. The program runs continuously, updating face detection in real time, and can be stopped by pressing the 'a' key. It requires Python and OpenCV to run and provides a simple yet effective demonstration of computer vision techniques for face recognition.
